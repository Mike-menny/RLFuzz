The user provided an error message from their code. The error is about the \'cstdio\' header not being found. The code line in question is #include <cstdio>. The error message says "fatal error: \'cstdio\' file not found".\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this error is related to cJSON. The user\'s instruction says to check if the error is related to cJSON\'s headers, functions, or usage. The error here is about the \'cstdio\' header, which is a standard C header for C++ programs. The cJSON error messages usually relate to issues with including the cJSON header, using incorrect functions, or parameters.\n\nThe error here is not about cJSON specifically. The user might have forgotten to include the cJSON header, but in this case, the error is about \'cstdio\' not being found. The \'cstdio\' header is part of the C standard library, so the error is likely due to the compiler not finding it. This could be a problem with the build environment, missing includes, or incorrect compiler settings. However, the error is not related to cJSON\'s API or headers. The user\'s code might be using C++ and needs to include <cstdio> instead of <cstdio> (though that\'s the same). Wait, maybe they meant <cstdio> in C++? Or perhaps they are using a different compiler that doesn\'t support C++11 or something else. But regardless, the error is about a standard header not being found, which is not related to cJSON.\n\nThe user\'s instruction says to output a list where 0 is non-cJSON related and 1 is cJSON related. Since the error is about \'cstdio\' not found, which is a standard header, the error is not related to cJSON. So the first element should be 0. The type would be \'non-API misuse error: related to fmemopen\'? Wait, no. The user mentioned that fmemopen is non-cJSON. The error here is about a missing standard header, not fmemopen. So the type should be \'non-API misuse error: others\' because it\'s a missing standard header, not specifically fmemopen. But the user\'s error is not about fmemopen. So the correct type would be \'non-API misuse error: others\' since it\'s a missing standard header, which is not related to cJSON. Therefore, the output should be [0, \'non-API misuse error: others\'].\n</think>\n\n[0, \'non-API misuse error: others\']']"""
